# MOVIE-REGRESSION
This project develops a Linear Regression model to predict a movie's box office collection based on various pre-release and production attributes. The goal is to provide insights into factors influencing a film's financial success and to build a predictive tool for estimating potential revenue.

Objective: Predict movie box office collection using a Linear Regression model based on pre-release and production attributes.

Key Technologies: Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn (LinearRegression, StandardScaler, LabelEncoder, SimpleImputer, train_test_split, mean_absolute_error, mean_squared_error).

Data Used: Movie_regression.xls (includes marketing, production, budget, ratings, trailer views, genre, etc.).

Data Preprocessing:

Handled 12 missing values in 'Time_taken' using mean imputation.

Transformed '3D_available' (2 categories) and 'Genre' (4 categories) using Label Encoding.

Applied StandardScaler to 15 numerical features for normalization.

Model: Linear Regression model, trained on 80% of data, tested on 20%.

Performance Metrics:

Mean Squared Error (MSE): [Your Actual MSE Value]

Mean Absolute Error (MAE): [Your Actual MAE Value]

Key Skills Demonstrated: Data Preprocessing, Feature Engineering, Supervised Machine Learning (Regression), Model Training & Evaluation, Python Programming, Scikit-learn.
